We sold our home and most of our belongings, I quit my job, and we hit the road in our RV to travel the country with our 3 year old and two dogs. We travelled 22 states over nine months. During that time I was able to really analyze what I wanted to do as a career going forward. Software developing had always intrigued, but I never had the time to devote to it. While on the road I was able to take a beginner course on Python and was immediately hooked. After finishing a specialization certificate through Coursera, I enrolled at the Coding Dojo for their part-time full-stack MERN program. I recently graduated from that program, receiving their highest level of test score and am now looking forward to my ever evolving journey into coding! </p> <p class="about-wrapper__info-text"> Beyond coding and software design, I love to be outdoors. Hiking, fishing, biking, camping, and playing sports are my favorite things. I also love to listen to a large variety of music, especially while coding. Being able to introduce our son to the wonders of the world has always been our goal as parents (he's been to more countries before the age of 3 than I had before turning 23!) and watching the world through his eyes has been incredible to experience. This journey has taught us so much and I'm looking for the right kind of position to be able to continue our crazy journey and bring my skills and love of problem solving to an awesome team! </p> <span class="d-flex mt-3"> <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="cta-btn cta-btn--resume" href="/assets/resume.pdf"> View Resume </a> </span> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section>   <section id="projects"> <div class="container"> <div class="project-wrapper"> <h2 class="dark-blue-text section-title">Projects</h2>  <div class="row"> <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12"> <div class="load-hidden project-wrapper__text"> <h3 class="project-wrapper__text-title"> The Sensory Series - Professional Website </h3> <div> <p class="mb-4"> Written by a pediatric speech language pathologist and early intervention specialis, this book was created as a source for early language and speech sound development.
