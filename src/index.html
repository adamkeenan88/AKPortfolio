                I was a paralegal for 10 years before my wife and I decided
                after COVID hit that we were going to take a leap! We sold our
                home and most of our belongings, I quit my job, and we hit the
                road in our RV to travel the country with our 3 year old and two
                dogs. We travelled 22 states over nine months. During that time
                I was able to really analyze what I wanted to do as a career
                going forward. Software developing had always intrigued, but I
                never had the time to devote to it. While on the road I was able
                to take a beginner course on Python and was immediately hooked.
                After finishing a specialization certificate through Coursera, I
                enrolled at the Coding Dojo for their part-time full-stack MERN
                program. I recently graduated from that program, receiving their
                highest level of test score and am now looking forward to my
                ever evolving journey into coding!
              </p>
              <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                Beyond coding and software design, I love to be outdoors.
                Hiking, fishing, biking, camping, and playing sports are my
                favorite things. I also love to listen to a large variety of
                music, especially while coding. Being able to introduce our son
                to the wonders of the world has always been our goal as parents
                (he's been to more countries before the age of 3 than I had
                before turning 23!) and watching the world through his eyes has
                been incredible to experience. This journey has taught us so
                much and I'm looking for the right kind of position to be able
                to continue our crazy journey and bring my skills and love of
                problem solving to an awesome team!

                    Written by a pediatric speech language pathologist and early
                    intervention specialis, this book was created as a source
                    for early language and speech sound development.  Inspired
                    by the children she works with and watching her young
                    toddler experience the sensory abundant world around them,
                    Jessica Keenan set out to write a series of books to
                    highlight children's sensitivity and wonder to different
                    sensory input.

            I graduated from a 16 week full stack coding boot camp in fall 2021,
            which not only provided me with full stack software knowledge, but
            really prepared me to jump into a software career with the tools to
            continue learning. Since graduating, I've been continually coding
            and working on learning new skills and languages to broaden my
            knowledge. I’m looking for a collaborative environment where problem
            solving and creativity are fostered.
